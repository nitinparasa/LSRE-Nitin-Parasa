### Questions:

1. What is Large Scale Requirements Engineering?

Requirements Engineering for the development of complex software systems for large scale industrial projects can be termed as Large Scale Requirements Engineering. This is also called as Market Driven Requirements Engineering. Typical activities that are a part of this are: 

1. Continuous assessment of Market needs. 
2. Collecting feedback from the customers (various sources in the market).
3. Constant identification of the competitor’s moves.

Performing these activities eventually increases the amount of information being stored in the databases dealing with requirements of the order of thousands. Managing, controlling, assessing these requirements in the industry can be termed as Large Scale Requirements Engineering.

### Reflections:

The articles given for this seminar mostly stressed on release planning and a detailed understanding on an industrial model named QUPER for the evaluation of quality requirements. However the article written by Bjorn Regnell gives a clear idea of what Large Scale requirements or Market driven requirements engineering is. Using this paper additional articles were found which helped in answering the seminar discussion questions. One written by Konrad S and the other by R.B. Svensson et al. stress on the challenges and the details into Large Scale Requirements Engineering. All the articles have been useful in actively participating for the next seminar which concentrated on the basics of market driven requirements engineering and the challenges involved and dealing with MD RE.

### Questions:

1. GAP/IVA/CVA Analysis?

**GAP Analysis:**

GAP Analysis is a measurement technique which is used to find out the positive or negative gaps that exists between what the product offers and what the customer actually want [5]. The analysts carry out this process in different phases where initially a check on the present status of the product is taken and then they check on what has to be done for the future. Then they analyse the gap that has to be covered from what is currently existing and what the end user (customer or market) needs. This gap as specified above can be either positive or negative. If positive, that favours the companies by the consumption of less resources and effort. Else, it is necessary to identify what is lacking and attack that as soon as possible.

**CVA:**

Customer Value Analysis (CVA) is a technique that helps in assessing the position of a company in relation to its competitors in the market. Customer’s perception of the value of a product deeply helps the company in predicting their products for the future. But here the customer value alone doesn’t help the companies to withstand the competition in the market. It is very crucial to assess the competitor’s strategies to do well. A typical example to explain this could be if the customers rate one of the product as good and if you notice that your competitors product are much more advanced and efficient, soon or later there are chances of the customers moving to those products. A good measure of the market-perceived quality and market-perceived price can be made using CVA. 

**IVA:**

Internal Value Analysis (IVA) unlike the GAP or CVA is mainly used for checking if the product is in line with the strategies of the company along with several criteria like money, time, etc. taken into account.

###Reflections: 

All the answers for the seminar questions are available from the articles given for the full-text reading. GAP analysis was briefly described by Tony Gorschek & Davis in their paper “Requirements Engineering. In search of dependent variables.” Using this information detailed information has been extracted from other sources available online. In the case of tools available for continuous integration none of the paper highlight about this. Information for this had to be gathered online from different websites. Two articles from seminar 2 were helpful in gathering information about Technical Product Management and Roadmapping. Brinkkemper, Weerd and Regnell have made good contribution in this field of market driven requirements engineering and different techniques involved in this. Other articles include the Requirements Abstraction Model which is written in the at the most detailed level explaining its readers about the problems companies face while collecting requirements and then assessing them and further grouping them or placing them at different levels of abstractions. Another article by Jaochim Karlsson about another technique used for MDRE namely the Cost Value approach is another detail article running through each and every concept involved for the classification of the requirements.

### Questions:

1. Can you connect all requirements directly? What do you do if you cannot?

According to De Boer et al. [1] requirements which can be related to the architectural level can only be connected to the systems architecture. Not all requirements can be connected. Being related to architectural level in this context means that they being not detailed enough. If in a case where the requirements can’t be connected to the architecture then it is mandatory to detail the enough so that these requirements can then be connected to the systems architecture.

### Summaries: 

**Scaled Agile Framework:** [SAFe4.0](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/)

Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) is an online, freely available knowledge platform consisting of successful patterns of implementing Lean-Agile software development. This framework acts as a guidance for those implementing projects using Lean-Agile methodologies. Companies implementing these techniques have seen a substantial increase in the productivity, quality, time to market and other crucial attributes. This framework has been founded by Dean Leffingwell. A brief preview about this framework is as follows. This framework consists of three main levels and one sub level. They are:

**1. Portfolio:**

It is the guidance for strategy formulation and portfolio communication along with organizing, managing the flow of larger initiatives and governance. This level consists of release of Epics, how the architecture keeps evolving and the product management coordinates. There is a portfolio backlog which consists of the present and future epics. Portfolio metrics is where different measures for lean portfolio, Kanban and the progress of epics is present. This can be depicted using burndown and burnup chart plots.

**2. Value Stream:**

This is a kind of a solution platform to the ones building large software and systems. Guidance can include Solution intent, management, engineering and architecture and most importantly value stream coordination.

**3. Program:**

This level describes about the Agile release trains, the agile teams that build the solutions. The main purpose of agile release trains is to align the teams to a common mission and provide architectural and user experience governance. This level deals with the social dimension of the scaling problem. This level consists of various technical people like the developers, architects, designers and customers. The features a products must have or popularly termed as Release Planning is done here by the professionals ending with working product demos. A typical agile release train is a combination of all these activities.  

**4. Team:**

SAFe teams are similar to the ones in Scrum. They are self-organizing, self-managing, and cross-functional teams. A typical team consists of Product owner, Scrum master and the team members. SAFe applies Scrum, XP and Kanban. They are reliable in delivering valuable, tested and working software systems on a regular basis. Continuous integration is a part of the development process in these teams to measure the quality of the product. 

**Paper 5:** 
In market driven requirements engineering, it is very essential to align the content that a product has with the needs of the customer to enable a profitable product. For the various requirements constituting during the development of the product, the selection process of these requirements is a challenging task. In this paper the authors perform a retrospective analysis on the decision making process in a typical large scale project. They aim at identifying characteristics that influence the decision lead-time and eventually the decision outcome. Decision-lead time in this scenario is the time that is required to analyse the impact of a decision from the time it has been reported. Customer requirements change very frequently and deciding upon these changes is very crucial to stay alive in the market. Identifying the factors affecting the decision-lead time and it outcome is of prime interest. A few characteristics identified in the paper are: 1. Number of product 2. Release number 3. Type of customer. Requirements Engineering decision makers face a lot of challenges like constant competitive goals and values, improperly defined requirements, politics influencing the decision-making process.  A few additional challenges can be as follows: 

1. Time stress 
2. Organizational goals
3. Incomplete information
4. Product Maturity
5. Uncertain environments

The case company that has been investigated in this article has more functionalities which has led to the delay in the release than for the later releases. The results of the survey show that there is a positive relationship between the decision lead-time and the number of products affected by that corresponding decision. This is negligible for large scale project but shows significant impact with an increase in the medium scale or small scale projects. The authors found out that the number of functionalities doesn’t affect the decision outcome as the time taken for a decision is the same for all releases. The type of customer influencing the lead time for a decision is like, for small scale companies the customers are given importance but when in the case of market driven project not much importance is given to the customer. 

The results from this study could not be generalised for the total community as this is a case study. Moreover it is stated that the respondents to the survey work in bespoke projects and the studied company executes market driven project.  Other characteristics like the number of stakeholders involved could also be investigated but due to lack of data they have not been considered. A future work as mentioned by the authors could be going into more depth about knowing the possible relationships among requirements engineering decision making characteristics.

###Reflections: 

The seminar discussions included of Boston Matrix and about the connection of requirements with the architecture of the software. None of the articles in the seminars discussed about these issues. They being general areas of interest, information had to be gathered from external sources. But the articles written by Brinkkemper and Wnuk gave a good idea on different techniques that are currently being implemented in market driven requirements engineering context. Another article by P. Calrshamre et al. describes about the interdependencies that exists during the release planning. They have found out different interdependencies like OR, AND, TEMPORAL, CVALUE AND ICOST. Other articles referenced above in this section have been used to gain knowledge regarding how requirements engineering and software architecture can be connected together. When it comes to the case of Portfolio management “Scaled Agile Framework” by Dean Leffingwell gives very detailed description and gives good understanding.

### Reflections:

About the team dynamics and the project related issues Scaled Agile Framework could be one possible development methodologies. This has proved to be an efficient framework wherein companies observed substantial increase in the quality of their products after the incorporation of this method. 

#Seminar 4: 

### Reflections:

The article “What Happened to Our Features? Visualization and Understanding of Scope Change Dynamics in a Large-Scale Industrial Setting” by Wnuk et al. gives a very detailed description on the scope changes that can frequently take place in large scale projects. Further discussion on the scope changes likely to happen and supporting a released requirements can be based on this study. For quality requirements a lot of articles by various authors augment this field of study. The one by Richard Berntsson Svensson “Quality Requirements in Industrial Practice – an extended interview study at eleven companies” are a start guide to base this discussion on quality requirements impacting other requirements, dealing with them and how they evolve over time. Additional studies exists too and could be found from the above articles also.
