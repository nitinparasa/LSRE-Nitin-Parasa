### Questions:

1. What is Large Scale Requirements Engineering?

Requirements Engineering for the development of complex software systems for large scale industrial projects can be termed as Large Scale Requirements Engineering. This is also called as Market Driven Requirements Engineering. Typical activities that are a part of this are: 

1. Continuous assessment of Market needs. 
2. Collecting feedback from the customers (various sources in the market).
3. Constant identification of the competitor’s moves.

Performing these activities eventually increases the amount of information being stored in the databases dealing with requirements of the order of thousands. Managing, controlling, assessing these requirements in the industry can be termed as Large Scale Requirements Engineering.

### Questions:

1. GAP/IVA/CVA Analysis?

**GAP Analysis:**

GAP Analysis is a measurement technique which is used to find out the positive or negative gaps that exists between what the product offers and what the customer actually want [5]. The analysts carry out this process in different phases where initially a check on the present status of the product is taken and then they check on what has to be done for the future. Then they analyse the gap that has to be covered from what is currently existing and what the end user (customer or market) needs. This gap as specified above can be either positive or negative. If positive, that favours the companies by the consumption of less resources and effort. Else, it is necessary to identify what is lacking and attack that as soon as possible.

**CVA:**

Customer Value Analysis (CVA) is a technique that helps in assessing the position of a company in relation to its competitors in the market. Customer’s perception of the value of a product deeply helps the company in predicting their products for the future. But here the customer value alone doesn’t help the companies to withstand the competition in the market. It is very crucial to assess the competitor’s strategies to do well. A typical example to explain this could be if the customers rate one of the product as good and if you notice that your competitors product are much more advanced and efficient, soon or later there are chances of the customers moving to those products. A good measure of the market-perceived quality and market-perceived price can be made using CVA. 

**IVA:**

Internal Value Analysis (IVA) unlike the GAP or CVA is mainly used for checking if the product is in line with the strategies of the company along with several criteria like money, time, etc. taken into account.
