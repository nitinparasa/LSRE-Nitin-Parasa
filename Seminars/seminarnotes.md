Answers:

1. Requirements Engineering for the development of complex software systems for large scale industrial project is Large Scale Requirements Engineering.

2. Challenges faced in large scale requirements engineering according to [1] are:
    1. Large number of customer requirements
    2. Formal interface to customer
    3. Management of customer expectations
    4. Changing Technology
    5. Distributed teams
    6. Traceability
    7. Resource fluctuation

3. The order of magnitude on the number of requirements with repsect to Large scale requirements engineering is approximately '1000' as stated by B. Regnell et al. in their article [2].
