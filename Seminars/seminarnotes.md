Answers:

1. Requirements Engineering for the development of complex software systems for large scale industrial project is Large Scale Requirements Engineering.

2. Challenges faced in large scale requirements engineering according to [1] are:
    1. Large number of customer requirements: Analyzing, Specifying,and managing the requirements at a large scale is burdensome and challenging to the organizations.
    2. Formal interface to customer: Communication with the customer is often formal and the number of meetings is very less with them being a huge number in the large scale projects. 
    3. Management of customer expectations: The expectaitons of the customer have to be satisified by the organization by showing a prototype of the model being developed. This over a large scale has to be propoerly managed.
    4. Changing Technology: A project ususally spans for several years. During this time technology changes and this has to be taken into account and addressed.
    5. Distributed teams: Many projcts today are globally distributed. Various teams from different geograpical locations work to finish the project. Handling and coordinating these teams can prove challenging.
    6. Traceability: Tracing out the requirements is a difficult task in this context as it requires large amount of time and human effort.
    7. Resource fluctuation: Team members join and leave the project during the development of the project. Knowledge transfer for the team members like information regarding the deadlines, deliverables, etc is a challenge.

3. The order of magnitude on the number of requirements addressed in a particular project with repsect to Large scale requirements engineering is of the order of 1000 as stated by B. Regnell et al. in their article [2].

Summaries:

Paper 1: 

- This paper mainly focuses on describing the art and science of Release Planning. The author states that the 'art of release planning' is related with the human intuitions and the negotiation and marketing skills they apply for conflicting demands. The science of release planning is a practical approach of dealing by the application of algorithms and formalizing a problem. Release planning is an important phase of any type of product development. Organizations often deal with various difficulties during the release planning, the prime one being the complexity of the problem being dealt. Release planning is often done adhoc, there are no methodologies to carry out this process. 
- According to the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) project planning is a very important step to establish and plan various management activities to execute a project. The author in this article elaborates the science of release plannng with the help of an example. Plannig has to be done to release a product within two releases. Several attributes have been discussed, which are as follows:
    1. Decision Variables: List of features planned for this release.
    2. Dependencies between features: The dependencies between features can be of two types. One is Coupling Relation which         intends that both the dependent features must be a part of the same release. Other is Precedence relation.
    3. Resource Constraints: Feasibility of the resources. What is the amout of resources required to develop the features.
    4. Stakeholders
    5. Prioritizing the features

- Then the objective function is derived which helps determine good release plans. The author proposed a hybrid release planning framework. It is a 3 phased framework starting with the modeling the details of the problem. Planning objectives, Resource Allocation and Stakeholder voting are all a part of modeling. Then exploration is done where an actual solution to modeled problem is derived. Finally there is Consolidation where the solutions are analyzed and modifications are performed (Scenario-playing and Re-Estimation).

Paper 2: 

- This paper discusses the working of QUPER a model developed to support high-level decision making in release planning of quality requirements. The main objective of release planning as mentioned is to maximize the benefits where 'benefit' has no explicit definiton. The author portrayed a few studies that stresses on strategic releae planning of quality requirements. One of them by Svahnberg et al. portray two methods addressing quality requirements 1. Quantitative Win-Win model 2. QUPER model stressing on quality and cost constraints. The author exemplifies the QUPER model and presents a full description of the application of this model in a company and various lessons learned. 
- Related work by Svahnberg et al. identified 24 different strategic release planning techniques where 14 are original and the other 10 being derived from them. The author states that two main factors motivated for the evolution of QUPER model: 1. A direct need of the industry 2. Lack of a suitable model to fulfil this criteria.
