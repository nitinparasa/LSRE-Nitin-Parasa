Week 46: 

Release Planning often is related to dealing with the requirements that have been collected by various stakeholders involved in a project. The main task in release planning is to separate the requirements collected into different groups upon whose implementation will lead to the development of a working product. 
It is not always true that the requirements gathered are always well understood and match the universal standards. People have different styles of expressing themselves and this is often misinterpreted by the analysts. Hence several meetings are conducted among the stakeholders to achieve clarity and eventually develop a good product. 
This week I have gone through the whole list of requirements elicited. I started to make comments on some of the requirements that I found which are very interesting and could contribute to. Started tracking the issues and commented on Issue #3 “Secure Product”.

Week 47:

Replies started coming in for the comments that I have made.

Issue 3: (Secure Product)
- Description: As a system manager I want the product to prevent unauthorised use, so that I can control who is using the system.
- Comment Posed by me: How about using the university provided credentials (E-mail and password) details for the login? Adding E-mail confirmation after Sign-Up would further enhance the security to the system. 

The professor found this argument interesting enough and asked me to add requirements for this. I started to think on this issue and will try to add in new requirements that reflect this issue in the days later.

Issue 4: (Limited Views)

- Description: Different classes of users shall only be able to access predefined sets of functionality -- those sets of the functionality that they have access to use.
-	How I understood this issue is that the customer wanted to restrict the entry into the product only to selected individuals but then I have no clarity as on how to differentiate the users and what are the different functionalities. Hence I posted a comment regarding this.

Issue 59: (Access to Discussion Forum)

- Description: Only participators in a course shall be able to access the course's discussion forum.

This needs a bit more clarity as of what kind of access id given to the course responsible? Is he also an active member of the discussion forums? Later on with the discussions of other members clarity on this issue has been obtained.
